# Login Automation with Selenium  

This repository contains a Selenium-based automation script designed to automate the login process for web applications. The script reads login credentials from a CSV file and navigates through the application to verify successful login.  

## Features  
- Automated login process using Selenium WebDriver.  
- Credential management through a CSV file.  
- Customizable login URLs and input field locators.  
- Error handling and result logging.  

## Prerequisites  
To use this automation script, ensure the following are installed on your system:  
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)  
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)  
- A supported browser and its WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).  
- Apache POI (if reading/writing from Excel is required).  

## Setup Instructions  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/login-automation-selenium.git  
   cd login-automation-selenium  
   ```  

2. Configure the project:  
   - Update the `config.properties` file (if applicable) with the base URL and other settings.  
   - Ensure the CSV file with login credentials is placed in the appropriate location.  

3. Add the required browser WebDriver to your system PATH or specify its location in the code:  
   ```java  
   System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver");  
   ```  

4. Update the XPath/Selectors for login fields in the script to match the target application's structure.  

5. Compile and run the project:  
   ```bash  
   javac FileuploadAutomation.java  
   java iPOapplication.FileuploadAutomation  
   ```

## How to Use  

1. Place user credentials in the CSV file in the following format:  
   ```
   username,password  
   user1@example.com,Password123  
   user2@example.com,Password456  
   ```  

2. Run the automation script. The script will:  
   - Launch the browser.  
   - Navigate to the login page.

   - Perform login and verify the process.  

3. Check logs or console output for test results.
